## What is React-Hook-Form?

React-Hook-Form is a flexible library that takes care of all your validation,
state management, and user data – and it's all packed within a size of 25.3 kb
(unpacked) and 9.1 kb GZip (changes with versions).

## FEATURES

It's simple and straightforward to use, and you have to write minimal code. One
of the features I’m impressed with is its performance. As mentioned in its
official site, React-Hook-Form: “Minimizes the number of re-renders and faster
mounting, striving to provide the best user experience.”
