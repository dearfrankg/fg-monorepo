## CONFIGURING TURBOREPO

- `yarn` is a package manager for node it can manage multiple projects
- `yarn` will be used to run turborepo commands
- `yarn` projects live under `yarn workspaces`

CONFIGURE YARN WORKSPACES

- `yarn workspaces` represent your projects
- edit `package.json` to configure where the workspaces live

```json
// package.json at the root level
  "workspaces": [
    "apps/*",           // contains projects apps/docs, app/web
    "packages/*",       // contains projects packages/ui, packages/eslint-config, packages/tsconfig
    "demo/*"            // contains my new project demo/my-demo
  ],
```

CONFIGURING PROJECTS

- each project's `package.json` file must contain these three properties.

```json
// package.json at the project level
  "name": "next-blog",      // project name
  "version": "0.0.0",       // project version
  "private": true,          // project privacy
```

CONFIGURING TURBOREPO

- turbo commands must exist in `turbo.json`
- we have configured 3 tasks build, lint, dev
- running commands for one project: `yarn dev --filter docs` -- start the `docs` project
- running commands for all projects: `yarn build` -- build all projects

NOTES

> In order for you to able to run a turborepo task on your project, that task must exist in the project's `package.json` file under `scripts`. In this case our `web` and `docs` projects are `nextjs` projects that have a `dev` command under `scripts`.

```
// turbo.json
{
  "$schema": "https://turborepo.org/schema.json",
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      "outputs": ["dist/**", ".next/**"]
    },
    "lint": {
      "outputs": []
    },
    "dev": {
      "cache": false
    }
  }
}
```

## SHARING BETWEEN PACKAGES

```
PACKAGES/UI TO PREPARE TO EXPORT

// packages/ui/package.json
{
    "main": "./index.tsx", // js        // prepare to export
    "types": "./index.tsx" // types     // prepare to export
}

APPS/WEB TO INCLUDE DEPENDENCY

// apps/web/package.json
{
"dependencies": {
    "ui": "\*"                          // mark as dependency
}
}

APPS/WEB TO IMPORT COMPONENT

// apps/web/pages/index.tsx
import { Button } from "ui";            // import component
```

## WHEN ADDING A PROJECT

- remove the `git-repo`, `lock-files`, `build-files`, `node-modules`
- insure the correct version of react is used: edit `package.json` to move `react` and `react-dom` from `dependencies` to `resolutions`.
- confirm your project's `package.json` has the three required properties: `name`, `version`, `private`
- install packages from root level: `yarn install`
- run the project to insure it works
