title: Tuples and Arrays in TypeScript
description: TypeScript offers JavaScript developers a robust solution to writing bug-minimal code. It offers more types and stronger type-checking than JavaScript. We’ll be exploring tuples and arrays in TypeScript.

## TUPLES VS ARRAYS

Why do we need tuples?

We need them to store data in an unchanging array, e.g., an employee’s personal information.

BASIC TUPLE

```ts
const primaryColors: [string, string, string] = ["#ff0000", "#00ff00", "#0000ff"];
console.log(primaryColors);
// [ '#ff0000', '#00ff00', '#0000ff' ]
```

```ts
const primaryColors: [string, string] = ["#ff0000", "#00ff00", "#0000ff"];
// throws an error because there's an extra string
```

```ts
const primaryColors: [string, string, string] = ["#00ff00", "#0000ff"];
// throws an error because all strings have not been provided
```

TUPLES WITH DIFFERENT DATA TYPES

```ts
const nameAge: [string, number, string, number] = ["Osinachi", 10011, "frank", 3556];
console.log(nameAge);
// [ 'Osinachi', 10011, 'frank', 3556 ]
```

The structure of the tuple needs to stay the same (a string, number, string, number), whereas the array
can have any combination of the two types specified (this can be extended to as many types as is
required).

```ts
const nameAge: (string | number)[] = ["Osinachi", 10011, 12345, "Victor", "frank", 3556];
console.log(nameAge);
// [ 'Osinachi', 10011, 12345, 'Victor', 'frank', 3556 ]
```
